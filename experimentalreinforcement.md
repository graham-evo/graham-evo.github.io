My proposed dissertation will be the culmination of work on two distinct projects, both using "island systems" to lend insight into the biological patterns and processes underlying diversification and speciation. Chapter 1 will focus on an ongoing, 4 year, 100+ generation experimental evolution project utilizing laboratory-adapted "island" populations of the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster.* This project will utilize an evolve and re-sequence experimental evolution approach to better understand the genomic properties required for the curtailing or strengthening of reproductive isolation under the reinforcement model of speciation. Chapter 2 and chapter 3 will utilize a genuine island system, fragmented populations of the endemic Galapagos carpenter bee, *Xylocopa darwini,* to further our understanding of the interplay between various evolutionary processes (i.e selection, genetic drift, gene flow) across replicated populations of an enclosed natural system. My dissertation research will combine a variety of approaches, some experimental, and other inferential and descriptive.

In the last decade, many observational studies have concluded that reinforcement - the strengthening of reproductive isolation as a direct product of natural selection following secondary contact of two partially reproductively isolated populations [@dobzhansky1951; @dobzhansky1940] ([@fig-1]) - is possible [Reviewed in @garner2018] and common in nature [@coyne1989; @dyer2018; @noor1997; @stre1997]. At first glance, these studies provide convincing evidence of reinforcement. However, at closer inspection, many of these studies rely on the observed pattern of elevated reproductive isolation of sympatric populations relative to allopatric populations of the same species pairs, often referred to as reproductive character displacement (RCD) [@howard1993]. Although it is true that RCD can be a result of reinforcement, RCD can also arise as a product of other evolutionary processes such as ecological character displacement (ECD), differential fusion, or interference in mate recognition signals[@noor1999; @howard1993]. RCD can only definitively be disentangled from true reinforcement by observing the process in action, rather than noting a particular pattern at a single stage in the divergence process. Only a handful of studies have convincingly shown, employing either experimental tests in natural populations [@hopkins2012; @hopkins2011; @higgie2000] or experimental evolution in laboratory populations [@matute2010a], that true reinforcement is possible. However, it is still unclear how prevalent reinforcement is in nature, and the specific parameters required for it's occurrence.

![Idealized schematic of the process of reinforcement. Some original population undergoes an isolation event that results in two allopatric population pairs. These populations enough time in allopatry to accumulate sufficient genetic differentiation and partial reproductive isolation. Another event brings these populations back into sympatry where they are allowed to interbreed again. Natural selection should favor individuals who mate within the same population to avoid the production of less fit hybrid individuals. Over time the within-population mating rate gradually increases, resulting in an eventual completion of the speciation process via complete sexual isolation.](/assets/reinforcement_conceptual_rendering.png){#fig-1}

The primary countervailing force against reinforcement is gene flow, which, in theory, increases the liklihood of recombination between preference loci and loci conferring low hybrid fitness [@mayr; @barton1985]. If these loci become disassociated during bouts of population intermixing, divergent populations are likely to collapse into a single hybrid swarm, as natural selection no longer has a selective mechanism. Few studies have attempted to experimentally quantify exactly how much gene flow is necessary to curtail reinforcement [But see @matute2010] and even fewer studies have explored the selective mechanism of reinforcement [@hopkins2011; @smadja2015]. Additionally, several experimental studies, many involving *Drosophila*, have failed to show reinforcement, despite incorporating all the necessary conditions believed to be required for it to occur [@hostert1997; @harper1983; Reviewed in @fry2020]. To test these ideas and rule out alternative explanations, one needs to simulate reinforcement and track the molecular evolution of populations through time [@fry2020; @white2020]. No such study to date has attempted to disentangle the genomic signatures of reinforcement in a direct experimental setting [@fry2020].

**Here, I aim to leverage two partially reproductively isolated laboratory-adapted populations of *Drosophila melanogaster* to test the feasibility of reinforcement under evolutionary regimes varying in levels of gene flow and selection against hybridization. Then, I aim to employ an "evolve and resequence" experimental evolution approach by sampling pools of individuals from each population at different timepoints of experimental evolution to estimate changes in allele frequencies as the process unfolds.**
