I’m an evolutionary biologist interested in how biodiversity, and especially genetic diversity, arises and persists. My work sits at the intersection of several branches of evolutionary genetics,  complementing comparative genomics of natural populations with experimentally evolved laboratory populations to better understand the processes that drive large-scale evolutionary change.

​My current projects range from experimental reinforcement speciation via reinforcement in fruit flies to phytogeographic reconstruction of Galápagos endemic insects using whole genomes. Specifics of these projects can be found under the research tab. A recurring theme of my work is the use of insects as study systems which provide powerful systems for understanding evolutionary genetic change. Their short generation times not only allow for direct observation of allele frequency changes in experimental settings but when coupled with large population sizes and relatively fast substitution rates, insects provide finer resolution for inferring evolutionary processes over evolutionary timescales in natural populations, especially geological young island archipelagos.

Since computational techniques are key to my work, I am indebted to the wonderfully generous evolutionary biologists and bioinformaticians who have produced and made available numerous tools and tutorials. I have made a special section of this website with a directory of these resources as well as some tutorials I've produced myself to help future students of evolutionary genetics.
